version 1.5 what could be added:

0. Concept:
- including recording functions into player
- optimizing performance (speed, size)
- information modes (settings, algorithm)
- two-screen and multi-screen options

1. Recording module:
DONE 12:46 10/02/2023 - menu button
DONE 12:46 10/02/2023 - information in the menu (blinking, showing time counter of the recording session)
- hotkey for starting the recording session
DONE 14:00 17/03/2023 - proper naming - adding timestamp to the file recorded
- selecting the folder for storing recorded files from Settings menu

2. Basic information:

3. Two-screen flexibility:
- setting different resolution for 2 beamers (bottom alignment)

4. Player options
- previewing the video folder before toggling the mode on
DONE 13:28 17/02/2023 - previewing the tagtool mode
- option for changing Spout input
- showing full filename text (ticker effect)

5. Guidance for setting up the system by Urbanscreen
- updating help for the installation
- quick menu

6. Mask Kantan post-module for the final image
- button for opening/closing the module
- button for toggling the mask

7. Masking grid
- selection between the cross and the grid
DONE 13:03 23/01/2023 - setting the number of grid lines
DONE 13:03 23/01/2023 - optimizing the grid performance (replicants->transform) 

8. Minimizing number of Error signs
DONE 12:45 13/02/2023 - debugging default folder for movie file-ins from the folders

9. Settings:
- change the tabs: 
Player settings (folders, preview, mode displaying),
Record settings (folder, format)
Display (number of beamers, source resolution, beamer resolution, open as separate window), 
Mapping (premask folder, premask color, mapping grid/cross, number of lines HV, color, postmask toggle, postmask open window)
Hotkeys
- simple settings, extended settings

10. Guidlines/Setup Master
- Set the resolution of the beamer
- Set the resolution of the content
- 

11. Recorder:
DONE 14:00 17/03/2023 - Timestamp on the recording - done
DONE 14:00 17/03/2023 - displaying the record status
- Selecting Folder for storing the recordings
- Selecting Recorder settings in the specific menu


12. Debugging
DONE 15:16 13/02/2023 setting default playback folders if on startup the folder returns warning (useful for initial setup)

13. Remaking stoner
- solving the incorrect remapping
- leaving only one stoner per sketch

14. Multi-beamer support
- make multiple beamers available and customizable (resolution)

to research further:
- storing and loading keystone settings in the separate image mapping mask
- storing and loading settings in the JSON file
- common trigger operator
- switching the button controls from small menu to a centralized module
- modularity - how differentiated should the modes be
- introduction mode for the module
- switching to GIT development infrastructure
